This summary was written for professional developers who want to know how to build reliable and
accurate machine learning models in Python.
 This is not a machine learning summary. We will not be getting into the basic
theory of machine learning (e.g. induction, bias-variance trade-off, etc.). You are expected
to have some familiarity with machine learning basics, or be able to pick them up yourself.
 This is not an algorithm summary. We will not be working through the details of how
specific machine learning algorithms work (e.g. Random Forests). You are expected
to have some basic knowledge of machine learning algorithms or how to pick up this
knowledge yourself.
 This is not a Python programming summary. We will not be spending a lot of time on
Python syntax and programming (e.g. basic programming tasks in Python). You are
expected to be a developer who can pick up a new C-like language relatively quickly.
You can still get a lot out of this book if you are weak in one or two of these areas, but you
may struggle picking up the language or require some more explanation of the techniques. If
this is the case, see the Getting More Help chapter at the end of the book and seek out a good
companion reference text.
